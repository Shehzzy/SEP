            <h2>Why We Started</h2>
            <p>In Pakistan, many children miss their important vaccinations due to various reasons - parents forget,
                can't find nearby centers, or face long waiting times. This puts our children at risk of preventable
                diseases.</p>
            <p>VaxPakistan was created by a team of healthcare professionals and tech enthusiasts who wanted to solve
                this problem. We believe that technology can help ensure no child is left unprotected.</p>
            <p>Our system connects parents with healthcare providers, creates personalized vaccination schedules, and
                sends timely reminders - all in one simple platform.</p>
